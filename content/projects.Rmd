Here is a list of the main R packages I am currently working on:


# TSstudio <a href='https://ramikrispin.github.io/TSstudio/'><img src="/images/TSstudio logo.png" align="right"  /></a>

The [TSstudio](https://ramikrispin.github.io/TSstudio) package provides a set of tools descriptive and predictive analysis of time series data. That includes utility functions for preprocessing time series data,  interactive visualization functions based on the [plotly](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=plotly) package engine, and set of tools for training and evaluating time series forecasting models from the [forecast](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forecast), [forecastHybrid](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forecastHybrid), and [bsts](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bsts) packages.


```{r}
library(TSstudio)
data(USgas)
ts_seasonal(USgas, type = "all")
```




More information available on the package [vignettes](https://ramikrispin.github.io/TSstudio/articles/).

# UKgrid

The UKgrid dataset is an example of a multiple seasonality time series. This time series captures the demand for electricity and its components in the UK since April 2005 using half-hour intervals. In addition, the package provides a function to extract, subset and aggregate the series into `tsibble`, `ts`, `xts`, `zoo`, `data.frame`, `data.table`, or `tbl`. 

The data was sourced from the National Grid UK [website](https://www.nationalgrid.com/uk)

```{r}
library(TSstudio)
library(UKgrid)
nd_hourly <- UKgrid::extract_grid(type = "tsibble", 
                          columns = "ND",
                          aggregate = "Hourly")


ts_plot(ts.obj = nd_hourly, 
        title = "UK National Demand - Hourly")
```


# USgrid

The **USgrid** R package provides a set of high frequency (hourly) time-series datasets, describing the demand and generation of electricity in the US (lower-48 states, excluding Alaska and Hawaii). That includes the following series:

* `US_elec`  - the total hourly demand and supply (generation) for electricity in the US since July 2015

* `US_source` - the US net generation of electricity by energy source (natural gas, coal, solar, etc.) since July 2018

* `Cal_elec` - The California subregion hourly demand by operator since July 2018

All datasets are in [tsibble](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/index.html) format

```{r fig.width=9}
library(USgrid)
library(plotly)

plot_ly(data = US_source,
        x = ~ date_time,
        y = ~ series,
        color = ~ source,
        type = "scatter",
        mode = "lines") %>%
  layout(title = "US Electricity Generation by Energy Source",
         yaxis = list(title = "Mwh"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: US Energy Information Administration (Nov 2019)"))
```
